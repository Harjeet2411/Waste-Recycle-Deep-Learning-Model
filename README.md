Increase in landfills,
 Eutrophication, 
Consumption of toxic waste by animals, 
Leachate, 
Increase in toxins, and 
Land, water and air pollution

**Implementation**

The dataset is used to train an CNN Deep learning model, which provided lower accuracy. VGG16 model was then used to improve the accuracy of the CNN model, then by data augmentation dataset values
